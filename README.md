### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ welcome to my site!

I am a Ph.D. student in Biostatistics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.

I am interested in precision medicine and developing statistical models for decision predictions. Working with Professor Thaddeus Tarpey, my current research focuses on the single-index model and trajectory analysis for functional data. I also enjoys collaborations with doctors in Medical School.
